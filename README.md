# System Administration on Red Hat Fedora and clones.

This is my collection of [GitHub-flavored markdown][gmd] notes describing the things I've learned as a [Fedora][]/[Red Hat Enterprise Linux][rhel]/[CentOS][]/[Oracle Enterprise Linux][oel] System Administrator. (Well, I know a lot more than this. Collecting my notes on [GitHub][] is new...) I cover a wide variety of areas.

- I have a [bash section][bash] with things like history and security improvements, and scripting ideas I want to hold on to.
- My [ssl section][ssl] installs the current version of OpenSSL, creates a host Certificate Signing Request and a Certificate Authority.
- There's a section on [ldap][] which installs the current version of [389-DS][389ds] ([Red Hat Active Directory][rhad]).
- I've just started a [kerberos][krb5] section to get that set up.
- And an [NFS][] section for setting up simple and Kerberos-aware NFS.

I'm also thinking about postfix, VPN, a Tor node, Apache, and many other services. For old time's sake, I might even start a [BZFlag][] server.
