# Installation and customization of 389 Directory Server.

2016-01-06:

The instructions are out of date, but the 99_389dsCleanInstall.sh file is up to date. The big change is that I've abandoned the installation of the Admin Server as more trouble than its utility was worth.

I may look into and write up [phpLDAPadmin][] as an alternative web-based management tool.
